# React Refactor

One of the most important skills as a Software Engineer is being able to refactor code. Take the time to go over this modules assignments and apply the following concepts:
  
  - Ensure proper use of React Hooks (useState, useEffect || Don't use the JS DOM)
  - Isolate behavior (Create React Components with Props)
  - Don't Repeat Yourself (Do you have any repeated code?)
  - Add styling to components (Apply TailwindCSS or BootStrap)
  - Add test suites to reinforce requirements (Utilize Cypress to create tests that reinforce assignment requirements)
