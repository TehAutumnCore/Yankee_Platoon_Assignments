# Pair Programming

## What?
-When two programmers work together on the same computer on the same task.
    -Remote version is screensharing

-One person 'drives' - hands on keyboard
    -The scribe. In charge of turning thoughts into working code that will function and execute
    -focus on the  details of the code
-One person 'navigates' - looking at the map, saying to go left, theres a traffic up ahead
    -the one who thinks about how to solve the problem, comes up with the thoughts, etc.
    -think at a higher level
-swap roles

### Tips
-Be flexible. When you're the driver, let the navigator work through their thought process, and make mistakes before jumping in.
-When you're the navigator, if the driver is implementing your vision a certain, let them run with it

## Why?
-evolved from Extreme Programming(XP)
-Knowledge sharing.
-Mentoring junior developers (and all skill levels).
-Studies show that less bugs are created with pair programming.
